Im currently working on a gamelike webapp for my iphone for habits, reminders, tasks and budgeting 

The design currently puts the habits and reminders and stuff on the bottom of the screen as different tabs or sections 

Currently what happening is that I want to move some of the sections (like budgetting) out of sight unless i want to see them. The first thought was a side bar kind of thing but it feels like it doesnt fit the game vibe any ideas or suggestions of how Id do it?

I wanna brainstorm and go back and forth

I like this problem! So you've got the main game-y sections at the bottom, but budgeting feels like it needs to be tucked away. A sidebar does feel kind of... corporate app-ish for a game vibe.

A few directions we could explore:

The "secret menu" approach - What if budgeting lives behind a long-press or swipe gesture on one of the main tabs? Or maybe there's a small icon (like a coin or treasure chest) that you tap to reveal it? Keeps the main interface clean but makes accessing it feel like unlocking something.

Map/world metaphor - If the app has any kind of game world or character system, budgeting could be a different "location" you navigate to. Like your habits are the main town, but budgeting is the bank or treasury you walk into.

Expandable header/top area - Instead of side, what if less-used stuff lives in a pull-down from the top? Could be styled like opening a quest log or inventory.

What's the current visual theme of your app? Is it fantasy, minimalist, pixel art, something else? That might help narrow down what would feel most natural.

Hmm the current UI is a bit simple so i dont mind taking feedback on it too as it still feels somewhat generic 

Thoughts on how to make it feel more like a game?

8:15 AM
Oh this is great! The aesthetic is definitely leaning cyber/tech with those glowing blues and the "LIFEQUEST" branding. I can see why Budget feels out of place in the bottom nav—it's the odd one out among the more "quest-y" sections.

For hiding Budget (and maybe Calendar?):

Since you've got that credits/currency system already, what if Budget lives inside a "Vault" or "Base" that you access from the profile card? Like, tap on the credits display in the top card and it opens a modal/sheet with your financial stuff. Makes thematic sense—your money/resources are kept in your headquarters.

Or even simpler: make Budget a long-press on the credits badge. Quick access without taking up prime nav real estate.

For making it feel MORE game-like:

Your UI is clean but yeah, it's a bit flat right now. Some ideas:

Add more depth/glow effects - That level badge has a nice glow, but everything else is pretty flat. More neon edges, subtle shadows, glowing borders when things are active
Character/avatar system - Right now it's just stats. What if there was a small character sprite or avatar that levels up? Even a simple icon that evolves
Rarity/loot feeling - Instead of just "Medium/Easy" for quests, what about color-coded rarities? Like Common (gray), Rare (blue), Epic (purple), Legendary (gold). Makes tasks feel more like loot drops
Streak flames/progress indicators - I see the flame icons (🔥) on protocols but they're tiny. Make those pop more! Visual reward for maintaining streaks
Sound design - Are you planning sound effects? Completing quests could have satisfying "dings" or level-up sounds
What's your take? Which of these directions feels right, or completely off?

2,3, and 4 seemlike a good idea, and yeah you caught on correctly! I  also intend to try to move away calendar.

And yeah something about hiding the budget menu within credits sounds like a good idea.
I suspect if i was to add a calorie tracking system id put it under health.

Nice! Okay so we're consolidating:

Budget → hidden behind credits badge
Calendar → being moved out
Future calorie tracking → under health
That frees up two spots in the bottom nav. What are you thinking for those slots?

For the rarity system - are you thinking of applying it just to quests/objectives, or would protocols also have rarities? Like maybe a "Legendary" protocol is something really challenging like "Meditate for 30 days straight"?

For the character/avatar evolution - this could tie in nicely with your level system. Does the character change appearance at certain level milestones? Or maybe unlock different "classes" or appearances based on what types of quests you complete most (fitness-focused vs productivity-focused, etc)?

The streak flames - I'm imagining these could be way more prominent. Like maybe each protocol card gets a bigger flame indicator, and the flame changes color/intensity based on streak length? 0 days = no flame, 7 days = small orange flame, 30 days = bigger blue flame, 100+ days = epic purple/rainbow flame?

Also curious - what happens when you complete quests? Do they just get checked off, or is there a reward animation/feedback? That completion moment is prime real estate for game feel.

Rarities feel like a good idea only for quests at the moment
That might be an interesting idea, but imm trying to make the app as gamified as possible while remaining grounded, its also why i internally have the coins like linked to a sense of reward of actual money. (it doesnt give me more money its more like it unlocks part of the budget researved for it)
Streak flames are interesting but im thinking of actually connecting them to the amount of times its been done rather than day based (as some protocols are weekly or every 3 days etc)
8:21 AM
Ah okay, that makes sense! So the coins are like "earning" access to fun money you've already budgeted—that's actually a really smart psychological trick. Keeps it grounded in reality.

On the streak flames - oh yeah, tracking by "times completed" rather than days is way better for varied schedules. So like:

0 completions = no flame
5 completions = small flame
25 completions = bigger flame
100 completions = epic flame
Would this be the same threshold for all protocols, or would daily ones need more completions to hit the same flame tier as weekly ones? Like maybe dailies need 30 for a big flame but weeklies only need 10?

For quest rarities - are you manually assigning rarity when you create a quest, or would it be based on something like the difficulty/value? Like Medium quests = blue, hard = purple, etc? Or completely independent from difficulty?

Back to the nav question - you've got 5 slots currently. If Budget and Calendar are moving out, what's staying/what's new? Just trying to picture the final layout:

Dashboard (stays)
Quests (stays)
Protocols (stays)
???
???
Are you adding new sections or just spreading out the existing ones with more breathing room?

I was thinking of making the bottom dashboard look nicer somehow rather than add more sections any suggestions or thoughts?

8:22 AM
Oh interesting! So instead of filling all 5 slots, you're thinking of a cleaner bottom nav with just the 3 core sections (Dashboard, Quests, Protocols) but making it feel more premium/polished?

Few directions:

Option 1: Floating dock style - Instead of a full-width bar, make it a rounded floating pill that hovers above the bottom. Only shows the 3 icons, centered, with more pronounced glow effects. Very iOS-game-like.

Option 2: Animated central focus - Keep all 5 slots but make the middle one (whichever is active) grow larger/glow brighter, with the others dimmed. Creates a nice focal hierarchy.

Option 3: Gesture bar - What if there's no traditional nav at all? Swipe left/right between the three main sections, with a subtle indicator showing which one you're on. Very gestural/modern.

Option 4: Curved/arc layout - Instead of a straight line of icons, arrange them in a subtle upward arc. The center icon sits slightly higher. Gives it more of that sci-fi HUD feeling.

Which of these vibes feels right? Or are you thinking something completely different?

Also - with just 3 sections, you could make each icon bigger and add more visual flair to them. Maybe each one has its own color accent (Dashboard = cyan, Quests = blue, Protocols = yellow like the button)?

Option 1 and 4 seem cool

8:23 AM
Yeah! Those two could actually work really well together too. Like a floating pill with a subtle arc to the icon layout.

Picture this: instead of the nav stretching edge-to-edge, it's a rounded container that sits maybe 20-30px above the bottom, with some space on the sides. The three icons inside are arranged in a gentle arc (middle one slightly higher), and the whole thing has that glowing cyan edge you've got going on elsewhere.

Active state ideas:

The active icon could glow brighter and maybe be slightly larger
Or the pill itself could have a glowing "highlight" that slides to whichever section is active
Could even have the background of the active icon fill with color while inactive ones are just outlines
Technical consideration for iPhone: You'd want to make sure it sits above the home indicator bar comfortably. The floating style would actually help with this since there's natural spacing.

Want me to mockup what this might look like, or do you want to sketch it out first? I could also just describe the spacing/sizing in more detail if you're already visualizing it.

Also - with the cleaner nav, that gives you more vertical space for content. Are you happy with how much room the Dashboard sections have currently, or would you want to adjust anything there too?
