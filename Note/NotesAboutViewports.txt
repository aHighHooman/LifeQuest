I made a PWA for my iPhone and one thing tbat haooens that irks me a lot is there’s this bar thing that comes that basically forcefully moves my navbar up. And I don’t know why. It’s quite annoying. Do you know why it haooens and how to potentially deal with this issue

This is a common and frustrating issue with PWAs on iOS! That bar you're seeing is likely the Safari UI bar that appears when users scroll or interact with the page. iOS Safari has some unique behaviors that can mess with your layout.

Here are the most common causes and solutions:

The Problem
iOS Safari has dynamic viewport behavior where the browser chrome (address bar, toolbar) shows and hides as you scroll. This changes the viewport height and can push your fixed navigation around.

Solutions to Try
1. Use safe-area-inset for proper spacing:

css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}
2. Use the correct viewport meta tag:

html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
The viewport-fit=cover is key for PWAs.

3. Lock your navbar using position: fixed with specific height units:

Instead of using vh units (which change with the Safari bar), use dvh (dynamic viewport height) or calculate fixed pixel values:

css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  height: 60px; /* fixed pixel height */
}
4. Prevent the Safari bar from appearing:

Add this to your manifest and meta tags to make it truly fullscreen:

json
{
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#000000"
}
Is your navbar at the bottom of the screen? That would explain why the iOS Safari bar is particularly annoying for you.

Does it happen even after moving the webpage into my Home Screen and it acting like an app?

6:55 PM
Yes, unfortunately it can still happen even in standalone mode (when launched from your home screen), though it's less common.

Here's what's going on:

In True Standalone Mode
When your PWA is properly launched from the home screen in standalone mode, Safari's address bar shouldn't appear at all. However, you might still see issues with:

The iOS home indicator bar (that little line at the bottom on newer iPhones)
The status bar at the top
Keyboard appearing and pushing content up
Screen orientation changes
Why You Might Still See the Safari Bar
The Safari bar can appear in standalone PWAs if:

You have external links - clicking links that navigate outside your PWA's scope will open Safari
The PWA isn't properly configured - missing or incorrect display: "standalone" in your manifest
You're pulling down/scrolling in certain ways that trigger iOS gestures
There's a bug where iOS thinks you're still in Safari (rare but happens)
Quick Check
Can you confirm: when you launch your PWA from the home screen, do you see the Safari address bar at the top at all? Or is it truly fullscreen with just the iOS status bar (time, battery, etc.)?

If you're seeing the Safari UI even in standalone mode, your manifest might not be properly configured. If it's something else (like content jumping when the keyboard appears), that's a different fix!

It’s full s teen with judt the iOS stuff

6:56 PM
Ah okay, so it's truly in standalone mode - that's good! Then what you're experiencing is likely one of these iOS-specific issues:

Most Likely Culprits
1. The iOS Home Indicator Bar That little white/black line at the very bottom of newer iPhones can push content up. This is what env(safe-area-inset-bottom) fixes:

css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  /* adds extra space so the home indicator doesn't overlap */
}
2. Keyboard Appearance When the keyboard slides up, iOS resizes the viewport and can push your navbar up with it. You can prevent this with:

css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  bottom: max(0px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
}
3. The "Bounce" Effect iOS has that rubber-band scroll effect. When users scroll past the bottom of the page, it can temporarily shift fixed elements. Fix with:

css
body {
  overscroll-behavior-y: none;
  /* prevents the bounce effect */
}
4. 100vh Problem If you're using height: 100vh anywhere, iOS calculates this differently and can cause jumpy behavior:

css
/* Instead of 100vh, use: */
height: 100dvh; /* dynamic viewport height - adjusts for iOS bars */
Does the "bar thing" appear when you tap on an input field, or does it happen randomly when scrolling?

It does reappear when I tap on input fields

It also appears when I open up the app

It disappears if I expand and then minimize my navbar

6:57 PM
Ah perfect, now we're getting somewhere! This is a classic iOS keyboard + viewport issue.

What's Happening
When you tap an input field, iOS brings up the keyboard, which resizes the viewport. Your navbar is probably positioned relative to the viewport bottom, so it jumps up with the keyboard. That "bar thing" you see is likely empty space or padding that's being calculated incorrectly.

When you expand/minimize your navbar, it forces a re-render and recalculates the position correctly.

The Fix
Try this combination:

css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  /* Prevent viewport resize from affecting navbar */
  transform: translateZ(0);
  -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
}

/* Add this to your body/html */
body {
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  /* OR if that's too aggressive: */
  overscroll-behavior: none;
}
Better solution - prevent visual viewport changes:

javascript
// Add this to your app's JS
window.visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  const navbar = document.querySelector('.navbar');
  navbar.style.bottom = '0px';
});
Or the nuclear option that works reliably:

css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  /* When keyboard opens, keep navbar at actual bottom */
  bottom: calc(0px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
  transition: none !important;
}

/* Prevent iOS from resizing the viewport */
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

#app-container {
  height: 100%;
  overflow-y: auto;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}
The key is making sure your scrolling happens inside a container, not on the body itself, so iOS doesn't resize the whole viewport when the keyboard appears.

I couldn't directly access your repo's source files, but based on the screenshot you shared and the typical iOS PWA keyboard issue, here's the specific fix for your React + Vite project:

The Solution for Your LifeQuest App
Since you're using React with Vite and your navbar appears at the bottom (based on your screenshot), here's what you need to do:

1. Update your index.html:
html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover, user-scalable=no">
2. Add this to your main CSS file (or Tailwind config):
css
/* Prevent iOS viewport resizing on keyboard open */
html, body {
  position: fixed;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

/* Main app container should handle scrolling */
#root {
  position: fixed;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

/* Fix navbar to bottom with safe area padding */
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  /* Prevent transform on keyboard open */
  transform: translateZ(0);
  -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  will-change: auto;
}
3. Add this JavaScript to prevent viewport resize (in your main App.jsx or a useEffect):
jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Prevent iOS from resizing viewport on keyboard open
  const viewport = document.querySelector('meta[name=viewport]');
  
  const handleFocusIn = () => {
    if (viewport) {
      viewport.content = 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover';
    }
  };
  
  const handleFocusOut = () => {
    if (viewport) {
      viewport.content = 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover';
    }
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('focusin', handleFocusIn);
  window.addEventListener('focusout', handleFocusOut);
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('focusin', handleFocusIn);
    window.removeEventListener('focusout', handleFocusOut);
  };
}, []);
This approach prevents iOS from resizing the entire viewport when the keyboard appears, which is what's causing your navbar to jump up with that annoying bar.

Try this and let me know if it fixes the issue! If you can share the specific file where your navbar component lives, I can give you even more targeted advice.
